		****MINI SHELL NOTES****
- initialize, interpret, terminate
- (initalizing the environment) extern char **environ is a global char array that stores other global
varibles but just the names and values, not the address, that is a seperate list. ex. foo=bar is at 
address 100.
- the basic program loop should be 3 steps (read, parse, and execute) in that order
- (read) read the command from standard input.
- (parse) seperate 
		****Parsing steps****
-(split by semi colon, then by the spaces)
-(store into 2d array)
-(one 2d array will be the command and the second will be the argument)
