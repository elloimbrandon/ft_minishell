					****PLAN FOR MINISHELL****
- start with knowing how to initalize the env and getting that ready
- ill probably end up storing everything into a 2d char array but might change later
- create a while loop to read the input arguments, parse them and store them into 2d array or whatever storage method i decide
- after storage ill need to execute the commands that were stored as input
- after execution ill need to figure out options for exitting
